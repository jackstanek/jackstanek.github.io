          <h2>About me</h2>
          <div id="bio-text">
            Hello! I'm Jack Stanek. I'm a recent graduate of the
            University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, with a Bachelor of
            Science in computer science, with minors in mathematics
            and German. My focuses in school were primarily in the
            fields of computer graphics (both real-time and offline)
            and programming languages, and I now work professionally
            in high-perfomance computing. Outside of my work, I love
            music, friends, and coffee.

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <div id="projects-text">
            These are a few projects I have worked on recently.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tiger compiler: a complete compiler for the Tiger
                language targeting the MIPS architecture, written in
                OCaml. A description of the Tiger language can be
                found in Modern Compiler Implementation in ML (Appel,
                1997); the Tiger language includes many features of
                modern programming languages, including typical
                control flow structures (if blocks, for and while
                loops, etc), nested functions, arrays and structures,
                and a static type system. This was written for my
                Introduction to Compilers class, though I am sadly
                unable to share source code due to the inclusion of
                unoriginal code as part of the course.

              <li>
                <a href="https://acm.umn.edu/~jack/stpaul/">St. Paul
                Capital Improvements Explorer</a>: I built this tool
                with a team of three for a Data Visualization
                class. Using data from the City of St. Paul, we
                created a map showing the distribution of capital
                improvement spending (i.e., road construction, park
                facilities improvements, library maintenance, etc.)
                throughout the city. Built with React, D3, and
                Leaflet.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/jackstanek/pathtracer">Pathtracer</a>:
                this is a homebrew toy pathtracer, written in
                C++. It's built upon a raytracer that I wrote for my
                Intro to Computer Graphics class. It's somewhat
                incomplete; it does recursive raytracing (Monte Carlo
                rendering is under construction currently), and uses a
                BVH to speed up large meshes.
