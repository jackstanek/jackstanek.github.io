# Jack Stanek

I am a second-year Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My
research interests lie primarily in the fields of programming language theory
and formal methods: how can we use formal techniques to reason about computer
programs and their behavior?

Before coming to Wisconsin, I completed my B.S. in computer science at the
University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I completed minors in mathematics and
German language as well. After graduation, I worked for four years in the
high-performance computing industry.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy cooking, reading, hiking, and music.
