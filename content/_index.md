# Jack Stanek

I am a first-year Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests lie primarily in the field of
programming languages and formal methods: how can we use language-based techniques to make programs safer, more
reliable, more performant, and more secure? 

Before coming to Wisconsin, I completed my B.S. in computer science at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. After
graduation, I worked for four years in the high-performance computing industry.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy cooking, reading, hiking, and music.
