# Jack Stanek

I am a first-year Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My
research interests lie primarily in the fields of programming language theory
and formal methods: how can we use language-based techniques to make computer
programs safer, more reliable, more performant, and more secure?

Before coming to Wisconsin, I completed my B.S. in computer science at the
University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I completed minors in mathematics and
German language as well. (Ich spreche Deutsch mehr oder weniger auf C1 Niveau.)
After graduation, I worked for four years in the high-performance computing
industry.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy cooking, reading, hiking, and music.
