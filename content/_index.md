  <h1>Jack Stanek</h1>

  I am a second-year Ph.D student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working
  with <a href="https://muraliadithya.github.io/">Prof. Adithya Murali</a>. My
  research interests lie primarily in the fields of programming languages,
  probabilistic programming, and machine learning.

  Before coming to Wisconsin, I completed my B.S. in computer science at the
  University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I completed minors in mathematics and
  German language as well. After graduation, I worked for four years in the
  high-performance computing industry.

  Outside of my studies, I enjoy cooking, reading, music, and going to the movies.
