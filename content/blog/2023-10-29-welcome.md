Hello and welcome! I am starting this blog in an attempt to start writing more
for a public audience.  I expect most posts on this blog will be of a technical
nature, primarily relating to computing, programming languages, and research. I
would like to use this blog as less formal and more didactic medium than
traditional published research, and I want it to be accessible to those who
aren't already in academia. I am passionate about computing, math, and
logic, but these fields can be opaque to outsiders due to their obscure jargon
and insular syntax. I want anyone to be able to taste at least a little bit of
what draws me to these fields, regardless of background.

There may be less technically oriented posts here as well: I want to have some
variety! The exact mix of posts is yet to be determined, though, and I will most
likely only be posting here when I have time, in between research projects and
coursework.

I hope you will stick around!
